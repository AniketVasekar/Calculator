# Simple Calculator in Java

This Java program implements a basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations based on user input. 

## Features

- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations.
- Prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operator.
- Displays the result of the operation.

## Code Explanation

1. **Imports**: The `Scanner` class is imported for user input.
2. **Main Class**: The `Calculator` class contains the main method.
3. **User Input**: 
   - The program prompts the user to enter two numbers (`num1` and `num2`) and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).
4. **Operation Handling**: 
   - A series of `if` statements determine which arithmetic operation to perform based on the input operator.
   - If the operator is valid, the corresponding operation is executed and the result is stored in the `output` variable.
   - If an invalid operator is entered, an error message is displayed.
5. **Output**: If the operation was successful, the program prints the result in a formatted message.

## Usage

To run the program:
1. Compile the code using a Java compiler.
2. Execute the program and follow the prompts to perform calculations.

This simple calculator serves as a foundational example for understanding user input and conditional logic in Java.
